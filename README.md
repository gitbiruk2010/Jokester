Application Structure

    Index.html: The HTML file that structures the web page, including a button to fetch jokes, a container for displaying jokes, and controls for background music.
    Script.js: Contains JavaScript code to handle user interactions, such as fetching jokes, playing/pausing background music, and changing the title color.
    Style.css: Defines the styling for the web application, including animations, layout, and responsive design elements.
    Public Directory: Contains static files such as stylesheets, JavaScript files, and media assets.

Features

    Fetching and Displaying Jokes: Users can get random jokes by clicking the "Tell me a joke" button. The application fetches a joke from the JokeAPI and displays it on the page.
    Background Music Control: Users can play or pause background music using the control button provided.
    Dynamic Title Color: The color of the title changes with each new joke, adding a dynamic visual effect.

Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the joke fetching process. If an error occurs during the API request, the application displays an error message to the user.
Customization
